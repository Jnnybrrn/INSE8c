Introduction PHDeasyGantt ########## Need to think of new name since phd students arn't in their 3rd year ##########

Our aim is to create a program that will help students in their final year plan group projects. This will help them by automatically
creating a Work Breakdown Tree(WBT), PERT and Gantt charts. This will be a website so that there is no tedius program downloads,
it will all be neatly saved online and accessable from anywhere. Our decisions made will be dicussed further in the report.

We started by assigning the managerial roles. George was the progress chaser because was quite pro active and had not 
missed any of the inital meetings. Jon was the secutary because from the start he was naturally taking notes, we felt that he
suited being the sectutary best. Stewart had a keen intrest in learning the VCS Git Hub, so he was assigned the git master. Dipo
was assigned the webmaster role, studying the optional unit web scripting he thought that he was best suited. Similarly, Abdulrazaq
is studying computing which involves a lot of database design, he felt he would be best suited for the database master.


***Add breakdown of any complex WBT tasks here***

***ADD WBT, PERT AND GANTT HERE***
*** Pert chart needs to be supported by a table of pre-requisites each with a very brief reason for the constraint. 
ie. Fill kettle -> Boil Kettle: Reason, Kettle must contain water.***
