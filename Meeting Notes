Software Engineering Meeting Note

--3rd November 2014--
George, Jon, Abdulrazaq, Dipo

We met in the library to distrubute sheets to those not present for the handout. We introduced ourselves and 
very brielfy went over the coursework spec. It became apparent that we needed to thoroughly read this and take notes 
so we just discussed our strengths, weaknesses and ideas. We briefly touched on who would like each role but mainly 
used this as an introduction and decided the work to be done for the next meeting.

This was the first group meeting. Objectives to complete for next meeting
Read through coursework sheet and take notes
Select what role you wish to take (NOT coding roles project roles) etc Team secretary, Webmaster etc.
Ask Kit the limitations of using pre built software, if we even can use excel/ docs.
Come up with suggested languages with reasons.

Stewart, George, Jon, Abdulrazaq

In the second meeting. Bringing our notes and ideas back we decided today we need to figure out. What we will build, 
who it will be for and what we will use to build it. In addition we would like to figure out who take what managerial roles. 
We started by getting everyone introduced to GitHub, then we looked at the options for graphical output.

C, C++
Clunky, only works on one format, requires installing, not mobile friendly.
Java
Requires compiler / interpreter making d/l large. Could be mobile friendly IF made into app but otherwise one platform.
Python
Prior experience says python really doesn’t work well.
Web
Need to configure client and server side seperately. Portable will work on all, with just minor CSS changes. More user friendly as needs no install.
Pure Tablet / Mobile
Would look most professional w/ inbuilt OS icons and stuff, not really platform of choice for big planning.

We have chosen to go with Web for now as it seems most appropriate. 

What : We envision a front page which has options to add, remove, edit and a list of items. From this central data we can generate the different charts.

Who: Students mainly, we are going to distribute a survey to get some ideas for how to make the UI etc

Platform & tech : Graphics - Canvas or SVG / combo / webpage
	          Database - for file purposes and generating bits
		  UI       - web, php and js mainly forms. As neat as possible. Simple

WHO DOES WHAT?

Progess Chaser - George, make sure all working to plans on time.
Team secretary - Jon, maintain cloud resources. Notes, GIT, Files etc (Second: Dipo)
GitMaster - Stewart, maintain GIT (Second: George)
Webmaster - Dipo, keep all server things working (Second: Jon)
DatabaseMaster - Abdulrazaq, keep all database working. (Second: Stewart)

BUGMASTER - ALL, WE WILL BOUNCE IDEAS TO FIX AROUND ALL

What to do before next meeting. (Wed 12th)
George - Survey
Stewart - Get familiar with GitHUB
Jon - Research other options : C++ / Desktop
Abdulrazaq - Research other options: Mobile
Dipo - Research WEB options for Graphics & set up GitHUB

(All to distribute)

--12th November 2014-- 
George, Stewart, Dipo, Jon, Abdulrazaq

Started putting our team plan together, mainly focusing on the WBT and PERT.  
We also carried on discussion about which platform to use, despite mainly looking at web last time. 
John found what looked like some good graphics libraries for C, so we decided to do some basic graphics in each 
of the platforms to get an idea of what would work best. 

Next meeting: 
Start trying out graphics in different platform languages. (e.g: html, java, C etc…) 
Pros + Cons on choices: 
	-Java/ Python
	-C++
	-Web 
	-Mobile


--16th November 2014--
George, Jon, Dipo, Abdulrazaq

We started looking at web options,

Ask kit about: If we can use famework/ packages in our project.

Dicussed pros and cons about all the diffrent platforms and languages. We've come to the solid decision of using Web. 

Adv of Java: 
-Fully object-oriented language faciliating modular design. 
-Desktop platform dependant 
-Secure
DisAd of Java: 
-Slower than C++, and many other languages. 
-Strictly typed.
-Not sutiable for scripting.
-Requires install of the JDK

Adv of python 
-free availability , python is open source
-good support for objjects , modules  and other reusability mechanisims 
-Easy integrqation with and extensibility using c and java. 
-Allows scripting.
DisAd Of Python: 
-Lack of multiprocessor support.
-Abbsence of commercial support point, even for an open source project(Though this situation is changing) 
-Software performance(though benchmarks repeatedly demonstrate python is comparable to java in most applications).

AdV Of C++ ( It's best suited for general purpose and low level programming) 
-Extremely fast
-Works very well for GUI programming on a computer 
-Good lanugage to write OSs, drivers and platform dependant apps
DisAd of C++ :
-Although it is platform dependants, it's mostly used for platform specific apps.
-A libary set is usually chosen that locks you into a single platform or OS
-Overly complex for very large high level programs.
-Overly complex and difficult to de-bug when used in web applications. 

Adv of Web 
-Lower costs 
-Allow progrmamers to pass cost savings on to end users. 
-Allow for quicker development of apps.


github dev pack
kineticjs - libary (Dragging and dropping) 
twitter bootstrap 
php backend 

For next meeting - 

Read thru /Libraries on the Git, get familiar with the options.
Take notes and bring cool ideas to next meeting.

No one brought cool ideas.

Data storage - What type of data are we going to be storing 
	     - How are we going to store it?

	Consider: 	http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp
	
Graphics - 
	Consider: http://www.jsgl.org/doku.php?id=documentation

Database -
        - Dropbox API  tutorial javascript
        https://www.dropbox.com/developers/datastore/tutorial/js
        
        Code to implement and query from database looks good.
        
Met after the Tutorial, had a look for Graphics, which we have chosen to use JSGL because of its lightweight and simplicity. 
For the data storage we are still deciding between Cloud vs Database on Server. 
To be able to decide whether the product needs to be online? Or can be ran via LocalHost. If we need to have a hosting server for the website anyway then implimenting an Apache server makes sense.
George made a digital copy of the WBT -> Which is to be added to the Report.
Initially drafted some of the text for the Report which is currently on GitHub. Needs additions and formatting.

To Do Before Next Meeting:
All to research WHAT HOW WHY - Re. Pert Charts.

To Do Next Meeting:
Come up with what DATA needs to be stored, ie. Tables and their attributes?
Turn the WBT into a PERT Chart & If time, GANTT chart also.
Get a start on the presentation.

--30th Nov--
Stewart, Abdul, Jon, George, Dipo

This meeting George & Jon made the digital PERT chart whilst Stewart, Abdul and Dipo started making slides for the presentation.
No big decisions were made during this time, we simply spent the time working. By the end Powerpoint has 8+ slides and Pert is 90% finished.

To Do Next Meeting: 
Come up with what DATA needs to be stored, ie. Tables and their attributes?
Turn WBT + PERT into Gantt Chart
Continue with Presentation.

--03rd Dec--(11 til 2 )
Stewart, Abdul, Jon, George

George finished PERT @ Home, Jon & George made the Gantt chart here. Momentarily swapped over to Google Drive because of GitHub uploading problems.
Abdul and Stewart continued to work on the Presentation - adding LifeCycle model and reasons for it, Reason for userbase & more.
George has begun writing the report on GitHub in basic form, ready to be added into a Word processor for formatting.
Stewart created a LifeCycle diagram, George edited the PERT to reduce it down to two pages.
We have arranged for next meeting to be on Sunday 7th. Rooms 1.5 (11-12) & Rooms 2.8 (12-13).

To do BY next meeting: 
Think about the structure of the Presentation - Strict Beginning, Middle and End.
Come up with ideas for how to Present it, Powerpoint? HDMI? Projector? Any extra bits?

To be done next meeting: 
Presentation - All group members to be working on the Presentation & Report. Need to get atleast the Presentation finished here 
so that we can use Monday & Tuesday as rehearsal / finalising time. 
Report - As above. Continue from George's work on GitHub.

--07th Dec-- (11 till 3)
George, Jon, Abdul 

All three of us working on improving and refining the presentation. 
UPDATE PRESENTATION PERT CHART WITH LATEST 

Presentation is done.
Report is 75% done .

To be done by nex meeting
we need to go through the presentation 
trim down the presentation , cut dowwn any excessive info. 
Updtate the presentatiion with the latest charts .
we need to build a new prerequisites table
get report done.



---------PRACTICE PRESENTATION--------

--8th DEC-- 11-2/3
Stewart, George, Abdul, Jon

We met up in the library. Fixed the report, it is now complete with all of the charts tables and such. Pre-requisite table is all done
We updated most of the presentation by cutting down half of the text.

--8th DEC-- 6-7.30
George, Jon, Abdul, Dipo

We met and commited who is doing what slides, and started to draft what key points to talk about and how
that all worked out with making sure we hit the end of the presentation as cleanly to 10minutes as possible.

Next Meeting ->
Practice practice practice... 1-5
More practice 6-????
